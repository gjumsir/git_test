namespaces
namespaces basically is a block of code to organise and avoid collisions, for example std
which is for the standard library has so many functions and we have our own software and 
and we name a function "cout". We don't know for who the "cout" is, is it for the std or of our
own function. Therefore we use std to be able to recognise to which function we refering to.

pointers
Imagine we had a pizza party with 100 of pizzas and noone showed up. We don't want those 
pizzas to go to waste, therefore we knock on each door and ask them if they want pizza. 
This would take too many recourses taking each pizza to every single door. So what do we do?
We give the address of the our place and tell them that we have pizzas and everyone comes
and pick them up.

So this basically what we do. 

We have a string named Bob 
string name = "Bob";
and bob wants to give his address so we can take the pizzas
string *pName = &name // & address of operator * dereference operator
The pointer *pName has now bobs address //memory address
cout << pName //this what the pointer saved, aka bob's address: 0xb14fbff760
and if we want to print out the address //access the value of that is stored at the address 0xb14fbff760
